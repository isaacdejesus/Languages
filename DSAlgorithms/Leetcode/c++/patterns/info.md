Patterns are important to undertanding loops and being able to solve advanced problems
## Patterns are solved using nested loops: 
- Where first/outer loop is for rows and second/inner loop for columns.
- .:. First/outer loop iterates rows
- .:. Second/inner loop iterates each col of the given row

## Strategy to solve pattern questions
- Outer loop, count the number of lines/rows
- Inner loop, focus on colums and connect them to the rows
- Work/print should be done inside inner loop
- Observe symmetry [optional]
