Repetition
file.eof() returns true/false if end of file has been reached.
Can be used in while loops:
while( cin )
{
    cin>>var;
}

Also be used with files:
ifstream infile;
infile.open('file.txt');
if(!infile)
    cout<<"failed to open file."
while(!infile.eof())
{
    infile.get(ch);
}


See page 338 for pallindrone example:
Two types of variables:
automatic: created during function call and terminated when function/block ends
static: remain allocated as long as the program exists.
Global variables are static
static variables are automatically initialized.
Ex-> static int y;   //automatically initialized to 0;
static var good if we want to declare a var within a function
and want those values to exist after the function has exited.
