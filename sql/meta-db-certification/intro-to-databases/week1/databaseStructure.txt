Databases are composed of tables composed of rows and cols
Tables are known as relations/entities/objects
Tables are composed of cols/fields/attributes
Each col has a unique name and datatype
Set of cols make up a row/record/tuple
Each row is uniquely identified by the primary key
Primary key can be composed of combination of tables
Foreign key primary key of another table used to relate tables together

Integrity constraints: There are 3 main integrity constraints
Key, domain and referantial intergrity constraints
Key Constraints: Every table should have a  primary key. Primary key should not be null
Domain Constraints: Rules for values that can be stored in certains columns/fields. Ex. Address can not be stored in phone_number field 
Referential Integrity Constraints: Data referred via foreign key should exist in other table

Database structure is how data is arranged in database. 
Related data is grouped into tables
Tables consist of rows(tuples) and columns

Logical structure of a database is represented using Entity Relationship Diargram (ERD)
ERD is a visual representation of how database will be implemented
There are 3 ways entities can relate to each other:
One to One
One to Many
Many to Many

Physical database structure relationships are established using foreign key.
Foreign key is primary/unique key in another table
Ex.

Student                                   Department
--------------------------------          -----------------------------------
Stud_Id | Name    | Course     |          |Dept_name              | Stud_Id|
101     | John    | Computer   |          |CS_Department          | 105    |
105     | Merry   | AI         |          |CS_Department          | 101    | 
107     | Sheerio | Biology    |          |Science_Department     | 101    |
108     | Bisle   | Maths      |          |Maths_Department       | 108    |
--------------------------------          ----------------------------------
Stud_Id is primary key in Student table, being used a foreign key in Department table
Therefore, Stud_Id is used to link/relate tables

*Multivalue attributes should be avoided!

Key attribute used to uniquely id an individual record/tuple
Candidate key is any attribute that contains a unique value for each row/tuple
Composite key composed of 2 or more attributes to create unique value for each row/tuple
Primary key used a candidate key
Alternate key is a candidate key not selected a primary key
Foreign key attribute that references a unique/primary key on another table
