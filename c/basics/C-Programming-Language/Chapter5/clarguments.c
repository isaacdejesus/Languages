//command line arguments
//two arguments can be passed to main: argc and argv
//argc- number of command line arguments program was invoked with
//argv- pointer to an array of char strings containing arguments
//argc- is at least 1 because argv[0] is the name of the program
//ex. echo hello world
//argc is 3, argv[0] is echo
//argv[1] is hello
//argv[2] is world
//the first optional argument is argv[1] and the last argv[argc-1]
